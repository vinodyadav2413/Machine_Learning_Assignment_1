Question 1

The following is a list of 10 students ages:
ages = [19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24]
• Sort the list and find the min and max age
• Add the min age and the max age again to the list
• Find the median age (one middle item or two middle items divided by two)
• Find the average age (sum of all items divided by their number)
• Find the range of the ages (max minus min)

Question 2

• Create an empty dictionary called dog
• Add name, color, breed, legs, age to the dog dictionary
• Create a student dictionary and add first_name, last_name, gender, age, marital status,
skills, country, city and address as keys for the dictionary
• Get the length of the student dictionary
• Get the value of skills and check the data type, it should be a list
• Modify the skills values by adding one or two skills
• Get the dictionary keys as a list
• Get the dictionary values as a list

Question 3

• Create a tuple containing names of your sisters and your brothers (imaginary siblings are
fine)
• Join brothers and sisters tuples and assign it to siblings
• How many siblings do you have?
• Modify the siblings tuple and add the name of your father and mother and assign it to
family_members

Question 4

it_companies = {'Facebook', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'Apple', 'IBM', 'Oracle', 'Amazon'}
A = {19, 22, 24, 20, 25, 26}
B = {19, 22, 20, 25, 26, 24, 28, 27}
age = [22, 19, 24, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24]
• Find the length of the set it_companies
• Add 'Twitter' to it_companies
• Insert multiple IT companies at once to the set it_companies
• Remove one of the companies from the set it_companies
• What is the difference between remove and discard
• Join A and B
• Find A intersection B
• Is A subset of B
• Are A and B disjoint sets
• Join A with B and B with A
• What is the symmetric difference between A and B
• Delete the sets completely
• Convert the ages to a set and compare the length of the list and the set.

Question 5

The radius of a circle is 30 meters.
• Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of _area_of_circle_
• Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of
_circum_of_circle_
• Take radius as user input and calculate the area.

Question 6

“I am a teacher and I love to inspire and teach people”
• How many unique words have been used in the sentence? Use the split methods and set
to get the unique words.

Question 7

Use a tab escape sequence to get the following lines.
Name Age Country City
Asabeneh 250 Finland Helsinki

Question 8

Use the string formatting method to display the following:
radius = 10
area = 3.14 * radius ** 2
“The area of a circle with radius 10 is 314 meters square.”

Question 9
Write a program, which reads weights (lbs.) of N students into a list and convert these weights to
kilograms in a separate list using Loop. N: No of students (Read input from user)
Ex: L1: [150, 155, 145, 148]
Output: [68.03, 70.3, 65.77, 67.13]
